There are plenty of reasons as to why I like technology. For starters I have been a tech savvy person for as long as I can remember. I also like the instant gratification that it offers to the kuser. Technology allows people to do so many different things, it just makes life easier. Tech also has a way of influencing the world of the creatives' mind as well, and help them express their inner thoughts and ambitions more fluently.
